007: Quantum of Solace tool
============
This is my little tool / trainer for 007: Quantum of Solace, which is a really bad port for no reason what so ever (as the game uses Call of Duty's IW engine).

Features
--------

  * **Field of View** changer.
  * **FPS cap** modification.
  * Ability to enable windowed mode (extremely buggy, useful only for streamers with 2 monitors).
  * Cheat for disabling annoying balancing mini-game (which actually may be framerate dependent).
